\section{External Interface Requirements}
% List all external systems to which this project will interface.  For example,
% consider a traffic signal control system.  The red-yellow-green and cross-walk
% buttons are a required interface.  The system communicates over an RS-434
% hardware serial link.  

\subsection{User Interfaces}
Our program will be run by end users at Kitsap Transit.

\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}
Our program will be run on Kitsap Transit owned computers.

\subsection{Software Interfaces}
Our program will use C\# as our primary coding language and we expect our program to be run on a Windows operating system. In addition, our software must be able to read and write Excel files. To store and retrieve data within the program, our software will interface with a SQLite database.

\subsection{Communications Interfaces}
Our program does not communicate with any outside sources.
