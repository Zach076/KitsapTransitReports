\section{Scope and Limitations}
% This section identifies what part of the envisioned solution is going to be
% developed in this current project or version, what will be delayed until
% latter projects, and what is out of scope for the whole product.  
%
\subsection{Scope of Initial Release}
For our initial release of the product, we would like to be able to import data in the current
format provided (.xls and .csv files) and create a report from that data set. We would like
to create visualizations from this data which are meaningful and useful. We would like to
make our software as user friendly as possible, both easy to learn and easy to use. 

\subsection{Scope of Subsequent Releases}
In subsequent releases of the product, we would like to support more file types to import
data and provide more visualization options for the user. 

\subsection{Limitations and Exclusions}
Our software will not draw conclusions from the data or reports, simply display it in a useful
format. We cannot modify any hardware on Kitsap Transit vehicles or alter data collection
methods, our software will only use the data being collected.
