\section{Business Context}

\subsection{Stakeholder Profiles}
% This section describes who will benefit from the product both directly and
% indirectly.  Identify stake holders by their roll and describe their needs and
% interactions for that role.
The stakeholders in the scope of this project include the employees of Kitsap Transit
and those who use Kitsap Transit services. Some employees of Kitsap Transit will be
working directly with our product in an effort to analyze bus route data and potentially
modify bus routes or the amenities of certain bus stops. By this, those who use Kitsap
Transit services may see changes due to the data we present in the product.Employees will
need a clear and easy to use product to show data in a meaningful way.

\subsection{Project Priorities}
% Prioritize the major features identified above based on the relative
% return-on-investment.  
The features which we need to prioritize the most is how to import the data given. We would like to make that as simple a process we can without detracting time from other important features, such as displaying the data in a meaningful way. That alone will be a lot of the design process for the project. 

\subsection{Operating Environment}
% Describe how and where the product will be used.  
We aren't sure where the product will be used. We assume that this will be used on Windows.
